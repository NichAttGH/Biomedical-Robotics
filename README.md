# Biomedical Robotics

The ' Assignment 0 ' is intended to help to become familiar with biological data and to refresh basic skills such as generating informative plots and inferring information from data.
Instructions and assignments are specified in the Assignment_0.pdf file.

The ' Assignment 1 - EMG ' is about EMG signal pre-processing and control.

The ' Presentation ' is just a presentation about 1 of several topics the Professor gave us with the goal of explaining the topic to the class.

The ' Assignment 3 - Touch X ' is about planar reaching task with haptic force feedback. Into this folder there are 3 folders where:
- ' Simulation ' contains files to see a simulation of the entire model without the real robot;
- ' Lab_Test ' contains files of the real model tested in laboratory;
- ' Phantom3Dof ' contains initialization files (without them it's impossible to test in real the model used in laboratory).
